# Illumio Challenge Test

Illumio Coding Assignment
1. As the problem suggests, the time complexity is the core component for this assignment. So faster lookup on the Ruleset for firewalls is achieved by using dictionary in python. Dictionaries give us O(1) lookup time. 

2. Improvements that i would have liked to add to my code was regarding the dictionary that i have created to take in dynamic values instead of fixed values like tcp/udp.

3. If i was given more time i would have tested the code using unittests. Although nullcheck and rangechecks have been tested through the testfile. All the standard inputs have been tested against the code.
